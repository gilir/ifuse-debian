INSTALLATION
================================================================================

For:
	Apple iPhone/iPod Touch 1.0/1.1/1.1.1/1.2/1.3/2.0+
	+ iPod USB cable

You must have:
	libiphone 
	libfuse-dev (and the associated kernel modules)
	libglib2.0-dev
	make
	autoheader
	automake
	autoconf
	gcc

To compile run:
	./autogen.sh
	./configure
	make
	sudo make install  # (if you want to install it into your system directories)

On Ubuntu/Debian, you can do:
	sudo apt-get install build-essential automake autoconf \
          libfuse-dev libglib2.0-dev

(make sure that you have compiled libiphone first)


USAGE
================================================================================

Now comes the fun bit!

To mount:

	mount -t fuse.ifuse <device file> <mountpoint> (if installed to /sbin)

	./mount.fuse.ifuse <device file> <mountpoint> (for local access)

Note:
	The device file is not important and can be anything but it will show up
	in the mtab, so sometimes it's useful.
	If you mount your device as regular user, system migth complain that file
	/etc/fuse.conf is not readable. It means you do not belong to the 'fuse'
	group (see below).

To unmount either do:
	umount <mountpoint>
or
	fusermount -u <mountpoint>


Currently ifuse (via the AFC protocol) only gives access to the
'/var/root/Media/' chroot on the iPhone (containing music/pictures). However,
if the device has been jailedbreaked a full view of the iPhone's filesystem
will be available with the following command 

	./mount.fuse.ifuse --root <device file> <mountpoint>

==== Setting up FUSE ====

Note that on some systems, you may have to load the 'fuse' kernel
module first and to ensure that you are a member of the 'fuse' group:

	sudo modprobe fuse
	sudo adduser $USER fuse

You can check your membership of the 'fuse' group with:

	id | grep fuse && echo yes! || echo not yet...

If you have just added yourself, you will need to logout and log back
in for the group change to become visible.
